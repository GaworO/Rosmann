Sales forecasting is one of the key business challenges. Store sales are influenced by many factors, such as promotions, competition, holidays, location, or day of the week. Reliable sales prediction enables stores to create effective marketing strategies and maximizing their profits. This project aims at finding insights from data analysis helpful for building effective sales strategies. 

For visualizations, we decided to use mainly the Wes Anderson color pallette, and theme "Economist", which we considered very minimalistic and stylish, yet distinct. The fonts, styles, and sizes have been uniformed in most cases.
